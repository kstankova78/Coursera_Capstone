Introduction/Business Problem

My client owns number of coffee shops in area of New Your and now would like to open coffee shop in Toronto where she can offer also different craft couses.
We'd like to collect information about the trends in the down town of Toronto. The goal is to decide which is best time for offering the courses inside the shop - morning hours or in the afternoon, bases on the people trafic.
